Current Bugs:
- turning quickly in place can result in self-collision


TODO:
-finish superApples - create a snake effect (speed? length?)
-score tracker and display
-pause button


Long-Term Goals:
-possibly refactor to make a powerup class, integrate different powerups
  .apple
  .superApple
  .length upgrade(good in two player, bad in one player)


-create menu (difficulty, num of players)
-two players!
